        <h3>Review Title 1</h3>
        <p>"I found the book to be a very enjoyable and thought-provoking read. It made me reflect on my own passions and skills, 
          and how I can align them with the needs of the world and my own financial needs. The authors also offer practical advice 
          on how to find and ultivate your ikigai, 
          including tips on how to set goals and create a sense of purpose."</p>

        <h3>Review Title 2</h3>
        <p>"Just completed the book. Had a great experience thought it would be short stories but it took me to a whole new different level. 
          And I had great experience knowing about the Japanese people and their lifestyle. 
        Soon I ll try to apply so that I could also feel the changes."</p>
